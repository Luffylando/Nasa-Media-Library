# Nasa Library Front End Project

Instruction for starting project:

1. Download/clone repo to your local machine.
2. Install all dependencies by running: `npm install`
3. Create .env file and add one variable: VITE_API_URL=https://images-api.nasa.gov

Im providing here this information since it's open API, else, I would send it in email as a secret.

4. Now you can start application by running: `npm run dev`

There you can browse trough nasa library and see some specific results of the search.

5. You can check basic tests written in cypress by running: `npm run cypress`

From the console just click on the tests.

Additional info: for cypress make sure your running port of application is the one defined in cypress.config.ts (baseUrl property).
